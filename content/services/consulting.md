# Consulting Services

At **Fairese**, our specialty is **iOS development** — building exceptional apps for iPhone, iPad, and macOS using **Swift** and **Objective-C**. But we also understand that successful products often need more than just great Apple platform code.

That’s why, when a project calls for it, **Fairese can contract trusted professionals** in complementary areas — such as backend development, Android, or design — ensuring your idea becomes a fully realized product without compromising quality.

## Areas of Expertise

- **iOS & macOS Product Consulting**  
  Strategic guidance for [Swift and Objective-C development](/work/ios-development/) projects — from early-stage planning to App Store launch. We specialize in technical architecture, performance optimization, and guiding teams toward App Store–ready releases.

- **Automation Consulting**  
  Streamlining workflows with tools like **n8n**, API integrations, and custom automation scripts to save time and reduce operational costs.

- **Architecture & Codebase Review**  
  In-depth analysis to ensure your app’s foundation is scalable, maintainable, and future-proof.

- **Product Roadmapping**  
  Helping you prioritize features, define a realistic release plan, and align your product with market expectations.

- **Full Project Delivery**  
  If your vision requires more than iOS development alone, Fairese can coordinate and manage additional talent — delivering your project from concept to completion.

## Why Work With Us

- **Decade of Experience** — Over 10 years building production apps for iOS, macOS, and other Apple platforms.  
- **Proven Track Record** — From startups to enterprise-scale deployments.
