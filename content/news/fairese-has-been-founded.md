Today marks the official beginning of **Fairese LLC**.

Fairese was born from a simple but persistent idea: to create a home for building software the way I believe it should be built — thoughtful, well-crafted, and free from the compromises that often come with client work alone. This company will serve as both a studio for in-house projects and a vehicle for select collaborations, balancing creative freedom with professional discipline.

From mobile apps to automation workflows, Fairese will be a place where ideas can move quickly from concept to reality, without being bogged down by red tape. I want it to be small, agile, and independent, so every project gets the attention it deserves.

This is the start of something I’ve wanted for years. Now, it’s real.
