### Andy Ibanez

[Andy Ibanez](https://andyibanez.com) is a senior software developer with over a decade of experience building native applications for Apple platforms. Based in La Paz, Bolivia, he works internationally under Fairese LLC, combining technical expertise with a philosophy of simplicity and maintainability.

Andy began writing iOS apps in 2011. He witnessed — and adopted — every major transition in the Apple development ecosystem, from Objective-C to Swift, from UIKit to SwiftUI, and from imperative code to declarative design. Over the years, he’s built and shipped dozens of apps, modernized legacy systems, and written secure protocols for sensitive industries. His technical range spans both sides of the software timeline: building new apps from scratch and refactoring older codebases for long-term maintainability.

His career includes work for clients across finance, aviation, and creative software. He's collaborated with startups and agencies, and also contributed to complex legacy systems in large organizations. Notably, he worked at Banco Nacional de Bolivia — the country’s oldest bank — where he helped design internal tools and mentored new developers as part of the Innovation Center. Other clients have included fintechs and aircraft maintenance teams across international markets.

His approach to software is rooted in clarity. Andy believes the best systems are not the most complex, but the most thoughtfully constructed. He favors pragmatic architectures, clean Git structures, and productive team dynamics — especially those that embrace asynchronous communication without sacrificing collaboration.

Andy is a strong supporter of mentoring. One of his proudest moments was helping a teammate transition from Android to iOS development, eventually becoming his right hand on major projects. While he enjoys mentoring, he also believes good mentorship requires good mentees: people who are proactive, curious, and capable of growth.

He is the author of a technical book on modern Swift development, where he introduced best practices in concurrency for Apple Developers

Andy continues to work independently under Fairese LLC, building apps, APIs, and developer tooling for clients who value precision, performance, and simplicity. He’s available for freelance work, collaborations, and long-term consulting.
