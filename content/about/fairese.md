### Fairese LLC: Native iOS Expertise from the Andes

Fairese LLC is a U.S.-registered software company founded by Sergio Andrés Ibañez Kautsch (also known as [Andy Ibanez](https://andyibanez.com)). While officially based in the United States, all development takes place remotely from Bolivia, a location that offers strong time zone overlap with U.S. clients, reliable infrastructure, and the ability to work with deep focus and autonomy.

### A Foundation in Apple Ecosystems

iOS development has been a focus since 2011, starting in the era of Objective-C. Over the years, expertise has grown to include Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, WidgetKit, App Intents, CoreData, SwiftData, and more. The work stays aligned with Apple’s direction by following WWDC sessions, beta releases, and the Swift evolution process.

Apps built under Fairese are properly architected — with modular design, mockable services, and long-term maintainability in mind. Rather than over-customizing UIs for novelty, Fairese emphasizes native design principles, ensuring each app feels at home on iOS while still reflecting the client’s brand identity.

### Clients & Experience

Fairese LLC has supported both large and small teams — from a Bolivian auto importer, [Ovando](https://ovando.com/), to U.S.-based financial tech like [Sharetec](https://sharetec.com/) (a credit union software provider), and even global names like Renault in a project management capacity.

Whether you're a solo founder, a growing startup, or an established enterprise, the company can adapt to your pace and technical needs. You can [view past clients here](/clients/).
