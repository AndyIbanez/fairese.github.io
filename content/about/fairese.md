### Fairese LLC: Native iOS Expertise from the Andes

Fairese LLC is a U.S.-registered software company founded by Sergio Andrés Ibañez Kautsch, also known as [Andy Ibanez](https://andyibanez.com). While officially based in the United States, all development takes place remotely from Bolivia — a country of striking natural beauty, where the snowcapped Illimani towers over La Paz and the salt flats of Uyuni stretch across the Altiplano. With reliable infrastructure, strong overlap with U.S. time zones, and a quiet focus-friendly environment, Bolivia makes an ideal base for high-quality remote work.

### A Foundation in Apple Ecosystems

iOS development has been a focus since 2011, starting in the era of Objective-C. Over the years, expertise has grown to include Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, WidgetKit, App Intents, CoreData, SwiftData, and more. The work stays aligned with Apple’s direction by following WWDC sessions, beta releases, and the Swift evolution process.

Apps built under Fairese are properly architected with modular design, mockable services, and long-term maintainability in mind. Rather than over-customizing UIs for novelty, Fairese emphasizes native design principles, ensuring each app feels at home on iOS while still reflecting the client’s brand identity.

Whether you're a solo founder, a growing startup, or an established enterprise, the company can adapt to your pace and technical needs. You can [view past clients here](/clients/).
