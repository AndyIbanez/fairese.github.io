Silvianna is a comprehensive AniList client for iOS, designed to make anime and manga list management both fast and enjoyable. Built for iPhone and iPad, it delivers a rich feature set that supports every AniList rating system, from 10-point decimal to emoji-based scoring, as well as advanced scoring parameters for power users.

Silviannaâ€™s seasonal chart lets users follow upcoming anime with ease, complete with notifications as new episodes are released. Airing series are clearly flagged when the user is behind, and Home Screen widgets provide quick, at-a-glance tracking. Notifications can be enabled for individual shows, making it simple to stay on top of a watchlist.

In addition to tracking progress, Silvianna streamlines rating and list updates. Users can edit any list field supported by AniList, including start/finish dates and custom scoring, without navigating through multiple screens. Profile access, search across the entire AniList database, and detailed character and series information are built into the app.

Silvianna Pro, the premium tier, unlocks expanded features such as unlimited airing series in the Home tab, additional widget options, full respect for AniList search settings, multi-account support, and customizable app icons. Pro users can also take advantage of extended editing capabilities and deeper personalization options.
