Back in 2017, while I was still in the process of finishing college, I had one dream: to create a software development company. I was becoming more involved in the iOS developer community on Twitter, and I kept wondering: *Will I ever be able to build cool things like these people?* They were running podcasts, launching products, and had full control over both their creative and technical processes.

The iOS developer community was a huge inspiration for me. But I didn’t even know where to start, and in my mind, I had a big limitation: I was from Bolivia, and it’s not easy to make money from Bolivia because moving money into the country is a mess. That’s why I decided early on that my future company would be registered in the USA, carrying the slogan *iOS expertise from the Andes*. I was already freelancing as an iOS developer while in college, picking up clients through the 2010s.

By 2018, I had finished my college studies (though not yet my degree) and was ready to try something new. My path through university wasn’t exactly linear. Between failed courses, retakes, and shifting my focus to building apps and freelancing, I stretched what could have been a quick academic run into a long, skill-heavy detour. While others were racing to graduate, I was already writing code, taking on freelance clients, and trying to make something interesting to fit into the iOS community I admired so much.

In 2019, while still dragging my feet on the thesis, I decided to relaunch my personal blog with the goal of publishing weekly. That promise to myself held strong for years, right up until I launched [my book](https://swiftasyncbook.com) in 2022. Around the same time, I landed my first full-time job at Banco Nacional de Bolivia in September 2019. It was fine, and I had some opportunities to grow professionally, but deep down, I knew I eventually wanted to do my own thing. The problem was, I had no idea how to actually run a company or even how to start one.

So while my heart was already set on becoming an independent developer and business owner, I also knew I didn’t yet have the professional experience or the logistical know-how. How would I get paid? How would I move my money to Bolivia? I needed to see how companies in the USA operated so I could adapt their processes to my own future venture.

In 2021, I left Banco Nacional de Bolivia and started working for international clients through [BlueTrail Software](https://www.bluetrail.software), a US-based company founded by a Mexican woman and her French husband. BlueTrail connected me with clients like [Sharetec](https://sharetec.com), [Cartier](https://www.cartier.com/en-us/home), [Renault](https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/), [Dacia](https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/our-brands/dacia), and [Castle Funds](https://castlefunds.com). My roles ranged from developer to team lead to project manager. I got to use English daily, learned a ton about how software companies operate, and expanded my understanding of multiple industries.

Still, I wanted to strengthen my management skills before launching my own company. In 2025, I joined [Trax](https://www.trax.aero) through [CodeRoad](https://coderoad.com) as a Tech Lead, working on iPad apps for the aircraft maintenance industry—an unexpected but fascinating career turn. From maintenance tracking to pilot logging and parts inventory, I saw firsthand how aviation companies handle complex software needs.

That role gave me the final push I needed. By mid-2025, I felt ready to take the leap. In July, I began the process of creating Fairese LLC in Wyoming, handling the paperwork, navigating taxes, setting up banking, and even building this very website myself. While I bootstrapped much of it, I’m not pretending I did it alone; the people I’ve met over the years are part of the reason Fairese exists.

## On the Name, "Fairese"

The name was chosen for a few reasons. First, I like the sound of it. Second, fantasy and medieval stories were a big part of my childhood, and the name draws from the word *fairies*. And third, when the name popped into my head almost a decade ago, I saw the domain was available and registered it long before I knew what I’d use it for.

The logo was inspired by video games, specifically Navi from *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*. In the logo, a fairy blooms from a flower, representing the journey that brought me here, and serving as a reminder to always “listen” to the people who helped me get here.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
